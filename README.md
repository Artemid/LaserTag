# TeamBattle

![Gameplay](gameplay.png)

Online game broken into server and client modules. Built in C++ using [Boost.Asio](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) and openGL/GLUT. Communicates via UDP.

Clients join into the session and are placed on either the red or blue team. The objective of the game is to hit opponents with the laser (space bar) to increase the team's score.

Honestly, I'm just happy I got it to work.
